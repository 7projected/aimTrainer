# Aim Trainer

A remake of an [old project](https://github.com/7projected/shittyAssDumbAssStupidAssReactionTimeTrainer/blob/master/shittyAssDumbAssStupidAssReactionTimeTrainer.zip) I made around a year ago, but better.

This was made with python 3.11.2 and pygame 2.4.0


# Changing Assets

The assets file is full of assets that i've used to make this project. Most of them are from JSFXR, so they don't sound the best.
You can move assets to the assets folder to replace other files that are of the same filetype.
This can change how the game sounds or possibly looks.
